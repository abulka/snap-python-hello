The reason the bin directory was renamed offline is because this snapcraft copy involves a venv, which ends up in the prime/bin directory - which conflicts with the existence of bin/ 

The reason our script bin/ is included in the prime DIR is because we copy everything in the source directory

  copy-stuff:
    plugin: dump
    source: .

I wish we could exclude the bin dir?  Solution: well, we can 'organise' and rename files and directories so yes, we can exclude it.

Even better, put the stuff we want copied into src/ and thus we avoid the whole problem of copying in stuff we don't need
